# PureCPP


This is an open-source modular RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system developed by PureAI, to which I contributed during my internship, integrating C++ and Python, deploying to PyPI, and optimizing for high-performance vector processing and querying.
It also includes careful memory control strategies to maximize performance, culminating in the development of a functional and scalable vector database engine.
In addition to its modular architecture, the project features orchestration and optimization through build and deploy pipeline scripts, reducing processes that originally took ~3 hours down to just 30 minutes.

> **Note:**  
> As this project is extensive and contains many modular components, this documentation will initially focus on explaining the parts I developed in the `ChunkDefault` and `ChunkQuery` modules, as well as their integration with the `VectorDatabase`.

# FUNCTIONALITY

## Core Vector Database Engine
I engineered and integrated the fundamental data structures that gave rise to the engine powering the Vector Database â€” scalable and high-performance core.

Focusing on:
  * `ChunkDefault`
  * `ChunkQuery`
  * `VectorDatabase`
  
### High-Level Functionality Demonstration
I have created a Jupyter Notebook that explains the high-level functionality of this components that I implemented 
This notebook demonstrates how these components work together and highlights the key aspects of the three main libraries involved.

### Low-Level Functionality

> **NOTE:**  
> Initially, I created these structures and functions in the directory `Chunk/ChunkCommons/ChunkCommons.h`.  
> I will provide further details and explanations about this part later.

# Disclaimer
These contributions reflect technical solutions I personally implemented, outside the formal scope of my internship contract, using no internal company resources. No confidential or proprietary information is disclosed here; all content is based on public open-source work.

This repository contains code I developed during my time collaborating with PureAI.
Officially, my role was focused on testing tasks; however, over time, I contributed far beyond what was initially requested, because is a startup.

I developed:
- the backbone architecture for VDB engine,
- C++ <-> Python bindings,
- modular chunk and embedding systems,
- all pypi integration
- and automation scripts for build and deployment.


While formally an intern, I undertook responsibilities typically associated with intermediate-level engineering roles. 

**License & Visibility** 

The repository is public under the MIT license.
Everything shared here reflects parts I personally worked on or played a significant role in developing.
There is no confidential or proprietary information being revealed here:
1. The code is already publicly available,
2. My intent is to explain and clarify the parts I directly contributed to,
3. I aim to provide technical transparency and highlight the complexities often hidden behind raw code.
